excerpt: We conduct a mixed-design user study with multiple robots to investigate trust, inappropriate reliance, and compliance measures in the context of a time-constrained game. We also examine how the effect of human accountability addresses errors due to over-compliance in the context of human robot interaction (HRI).

This paper examines how people's trust and dependence on robot teammates providing decision support varies as a function
of different attributes of the robot, such as perceived anthropomorphism, type of support provided by the robot, 
and its physical presence. We conduct a mixed-design user study with multiple robots to investigate trust, inappropriate 
reliance, and compliance measures in the context of a time-constrained game.
We also examine how the effect of human accountability addresses errors due to over-compliance in the context of human robot interaction (HRI).
