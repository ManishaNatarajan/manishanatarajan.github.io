I'm a first year Robotics PhD student in the School of Interactive
Computing at Georgia Tech. I work in the [CORE Robotics Lab](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/) 
with [Dr. Matthew Gombolay](https://core-robotics.gatech.edu/people/matthew-gombolay/). Prior to starting my
PhD, I completed my Masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Georgia Tech and 
my Bachelors in Electrical and Electronics from M.S. Ramaiah Institute of Technology, India. 

My primary research interests include applying machine learning techniques in robotics 
and human robot interaction. Particularly, I am interested in understanding how we can
leverage human demonstrations to help robots learn new tasks and work fluently with
humans in shared workspaces. I am currently working on using natural language and human
demonstrations via inverse reinforcement learning to help AI agents accomplish multiple 
tasks in virtual environments.

I have a strong passion for education. I have been an active volunteer for [Asha for Education](https://atlanta.ashanet.org/),
a non-profit organization aimed at supporting the education of underprivileged children for 
the past three years. I also tutor middle school kids through [eVidyaloka](https://www.evidyaloka.org/).
In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, and sketching.
