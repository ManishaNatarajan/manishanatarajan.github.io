## Trust in Human-Robot Interaction

<br />
Conducted a user study to examine trust in robots 
as assistive agents by varying the 
following conditions:
- **Robots:** Used robots with diffferent physical characteristics 
ranging from simple manipulators to humanoids as assistive agents in the study
- **Behavior:** Robots exhibit different behaviors (apologetic, indifferent, etc.)
while providing feedback to the users
- **Embodiment:** Users interact with both embodied robots and virtual
agents (videos of robots)
- **Coalition-Building:** Robots may or may not provide context for
their behaviors.

Results indicate that users tend to perform better when the 
robot holds them accountable for their mistakes and trust robots that
tend to be apologetic after providing incorrect assistance. Introducing
a coalition-building preface increases trust in the robot.

## Solving Kidnapped Robot using Particle Filter

Implemented particle filter from scratch to localize a lost
robot in a hallway by utilizing readings from laser rangefinder, 
and odometry data.
